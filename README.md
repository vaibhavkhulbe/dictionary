# dictionary

This project was made as a part of Algorithms and Problem Solving Course and implements Trie on secondary storage.

In this the meanings of the words are stored at the folder with path consisting of one letter at a time.

 For example, to search "folder" you need to go through root/f/o/l/d/e/r/ where you will find "folder.txt" with the meaning of the word written on it.
 
 The project is still under building stage though it functions well.
 
 To run it you need code::blocks svn build as it uses winBGIm library which is easy to handle in svn build version.
